## App Brainstorming

### My Favorite Apps
1. Instagram
   - Photo sharing with filters
   - Direct messaging
2. YouTube
   - Video streaming
   - Subscriptions and notifications
3. Spotify
   - Music streaming
   - Playlist creation

### My App Idea
**Business Profit Tracker:** An app that helps small business owners track their income, expenses, and calculate daily profit. It will include:
- A dashboard view showing total income, expenses, and net profit.
- A feature to log income and expenses with categories.
- Visual insights with simple graphs showing income vs. expenses.
- Daily summary notification showing total income, expenses, and profit.

##  Notes
- The main challenge I faced was understanding how to connect the button to the code (IBAction).
- I also learned how to create a random color using Swiftâ€™s `CGFloat.random(in: 0...1)` method.
